<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Dr. Sonya Prince. I am the second of three daughters. I have one beautiful neice and she is becone my niece daughter within the past year as a result of her mother's (which is my sister) passing in May of 2022. I have one living parent which is my dad. I enjoy spending time with my family as much as possible. In my spare time, I enjoy all kinds of adventurous. I like to learn new things, I enjoy bowling, fishing, shopping, watching movies or going to the movie theater, dinign out, cooking, sewing, and so much more! </p>

<p>I have experience and skills in many areas. I am a licensed real estate agent, business owner, and innovator. I have many interests including that of technology and digital creation. I have been in education for over 20 years in various capacities across the board from serving as a janitorial employee , teacher coach/mentor, paraprofessional/assistant to lead teacher as well as administration. Iâ€™ve worked with scholars from infant through post-secondary education. Early childhood was the start of my journey. I spent a few years working with gifted learners (K-3) and had the pleasure of working with both general education and special education students (K-12). I also serve on GCU doctoral committees as a content expert. I would like to share and facilitate learning throughout my life.

<p>If I could be anyone in the world, I would simply be the best version of myself. If I could travel anywhere in the world, I would go many places as a world tour and stop for longer periods of time in the most peaceful places. I seek to be the best person for people in need. Creativity is something I love! Spare me the drama! </p>
